# Finger-Guessing-Game-Simulation
The project aims to simulate 10,000 games between two players, P1 and P2, following specific rules. The players simultaneously show and guess the number of fingers the other player will display. Based on their correct or incorrect guesses, winnings are calculated and plotted in a histogram to visualize the distribution of P1's winnings.
